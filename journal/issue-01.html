    <h3>Opening</h3>
    <p>Hi.</p>

    <p>
        This is… strange.
        I suppose this is my first official journal entry.
        If you're reading this, then the broadcast worked.
    </p>

    <p>
        Welcome to the Katachi Weekly Journal.
    </p>

    <p>
        I didn’t want this project to be just a download page.
        I wanted something that feels alive.
        So here we are.
    </p>

    <h3>What’s Happening Right Now</h3>

    <p>
        Things are still being built.
    </p>

    <p>
        The voicebank is being refined.
        The websites are slowly evolving.
        Pages appear. Layouts change. Ideas expand.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nothing is rushed.
        I’d rather grow carefully than loudly.
    </p>

    <h3>About This Journal</h3>

    <p>
        This space will be updated weekly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes I’ll talk about development.
        Sometimes about ideas.
        Sometimes about things that don’t fit anywhere else.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe I’ll highlight community works in the future.
        Maybe I’ll experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
        We’ll see.
        That’s the fun part.
    </p>

    <h3>A Small Thought</h3>

    <p>
        A voice doesn’t really exist until someone listens.
    </p>

    <p>
        So if you’re here —
        reading this first entry —
        thank you.
    </p>

    <p>
        You’re part of my shape now.
    </p>

    <h3>Closing</h3>

    <p>
        That’s it for the first transmission.
    </p>

    <p>
        It feels small.
        But beginnings always are.
    </p>

    <p>
        See you next week.
    </p>
